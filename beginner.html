  <h2>üß∞ Part 1: Crochet Tools & Their Meanings</h2>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Crochet Hook</h3>
    <p>A tool with a small hook at one end, used to loop yarn through other loops. Crochet hooks come in different sizes (measured in mm) and materials like metal, plastic, bamboo, or wood. The size of the hook affects how tight or loose your stitches are.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Yarn</h3>
    <p>The thread or fiber you use to crochet. Yarns come in various weights (like DK, worsted, or chunky), fibers (like cotton, wool, or acrylic), and textures. Beginners often start with medium-weight acrylic yarn because it's easy to handle and affordable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Scissors</h3>
    <p>Used for cutting yarn cleanly. A small, sharp pair of scissors helps ensure your yarn ends don‚Äôt fray and your work looks neat.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Tapestry Needle (or Yarn Needle)</h3>
    <p>A large, blunt needle used to weave in loose ends of yarn after you've finished your crochet project. It can also be used to sew pieces together.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Stitch Markers</h3>
    <p>Helpful little clips or rings used to mark your place in a pattern. For example, you can use them to keep track of the beginning of a round, or a special stitch. They're especially useful in more complex projects.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Measuring Tape</h3>
    <p>Used to measure your work so that it matches the required size in a pattern. This is important when making clothing or accessories that need to fit properly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Row Counter</h3>
    <p>This tool helps you keep track of how many rows or rounds you've done. You can use a digital one, a clicker, or simply a notebook or app.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Yarn Bowl</h3>
    <p>A bowl designed to hold your ball of yarn and keep it from rolling around while you crochet. Some have a spiral cutout to feed the yarn through as you work.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Blocking Mat & Pins</h3>
    <p>Used to shape and stretch your finished pieces to their correct size and form. This step is called ‚Äúblocking‚Äù and helps your project look more polished and professional.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Gauge Ruler / Gauge Checker</h3>
    <p>A tool that helps you check how many stitches and rows fit into a certain measurement (usually 4 inches). It‚Äôs essential when following patterns to make sure your project comes out the right size.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Project Bag</h3>
    <p>A storage bag to keep your yarn, hooks, scissors, and in-progress projects safe and organized, especially when you're working on the go.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool-section">
    <h3>Hook Organizer</h3>
    <p>A pouch or stand that holds your crochet hooks neatly so you can easily find the size you need.</p>
  </div>

    <img src="chain.jpg" alt="Chain Stitch Example" class="lesson-img">
    <p>
      The chain stitch is the foundation of most crochet patterns. It‚Äôs made by looping the yarn around the hook and pulling it through the existing loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practice making several chain stitches until you‚Äôre comfortable with holding the yarn and the hook.

    <img src="circle.jpg" alt="Crochet Circle Example" class="lesson-img">
    <p>
      Crocheting a circle involves working into a central ring and increasing in each round. It‚Äôs great for hats, coasters, and amigurumi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with a magic ring or chain 4 and join to form a loop, then work stitches into it.
