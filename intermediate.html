    <img src="double.jpg" alt="Double Crochet Example" class="lesson-img">
    <p>
    A double crochet stitch is one of the most basic and versatile stitches in crochet. To make a double crochet, you begin by yarn over and inserting your hook into the stitch. You then yarn over again and pull through, leaving three loops on your hook. Next, yarn over and pull through the first two loops, leaving two loops remaining. Finally, yarn over once more and pull through the last two loops. This stitch creates a tall, textured pattern that's great for projects like blankets, scarves, and garments. Double crochet provides a balance between openness and structure, making it ideal for both dense and airy designs. Mastering the double crochet is essential for advancing to more complex crochet techniques.

    <p>A crochet scarf is a versatile and cozy accessory that can be made with various stitches, yarn types, and patterns. To make a basic crochet scarf, you begin by chaining a desired length of foundation chains, depending on how wide you want the scarf to be. Then, you can choose a stitch pattern‚Äîsuch as single crochet, double crochet, or a textured stitch‚Äîto work back and forth across the row. The scarf can be made in any length to suit your preference, typically ranging from a shorter fashion scarf to a long, wrap-around style. Adding fringe at the ends is a common way to finish the scarf, giving it a stylish touch. Crochet scarves are great for beginners due to their simplicity and the ability to customize them with colors and textures. They make perfect handmade gifts and are ideal for keeping warm during cooler seasons.

    <h2>üé© How to Crochet a Hat</h2>
    <img src="hat.jpg" alt="Crochet Hat Example" class="lesson-img">
    <p>A crochet hat is a popular and practical project, offering both warmth and style. To start, you typically begin by creating a magic ring, which forms the foundation of the hat. Then, you crochet in the round, gradually increasing the number of stitches to create the hat's base. Common stitches for crochet hats include single crochet, half double crochet, and double crochet, depending on the desired texture and thickness. As you work in rounds, you can adjust the size to fit your head, and once the crown of the hat is complete, you begin working even without increasing to form the sides. To finish, the last few rows are often worked in ribbing or a tighter stitch to give the hat structure. Adding embellishments like pom-poms, buttons, or other decorative details can make the hat unique. Crochet hats are quick to make, making them perfect for gifts or personal use, especially during cold weather.</p>

    <h2>üß∫ Bonus: Crochet a Basket</h2>
    <img src="basket.jpg" alt="Crochet Basket Example" class="lesson-img">
    <p>A crochet basket is a functional and stylish item that can be used for organizing or as a decorative piece in your home. To make a crochet basket, you typically start by creating a sturdy base using a round shape, often starting with a magic ring or a chain loop. Then, you crochet in the round, gradually increasing stitches to make the base large enough for the desired size of the basket. After the base is complete, you continue working in rounds without increasing to form the sides of the basket. The stitch pattern can vary depending on the look and texture you want, with single crochet or slip stitches being popular choices for a tight, sturdy finish. You can also use thicker yarn or multiple strands of yarn to add more durability. For added structure, some people insert a wire or stiff material into the bottom of the basket. The final step often involves adding a handle or two for easy carrying. Crochet baskets are great for organizing small items or as decorative accents around the house, and they make thoughtful, handmade gifts.</p>
